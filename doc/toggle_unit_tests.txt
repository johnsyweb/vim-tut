USAGE

Use this plug-in when you are doing Test-Driven Development [TDD] in any
language to quickly switch between unit-test and production code. To make this
really fast bind the Toggle function to a function key in your .vimrc:

    "   [F3]    toggles between (header, ) source and test files.
    nnoremap    <F3> :<C-U>TUT<CR>

This plug-in assumes source and unit test files are in the same directory.

SETTINGS

By default, unit_test filenames are deemed to begin with 't_'.

variable, perhaps in your .vimrc:
>
    let g:unit_test_prefix='test_'
<
