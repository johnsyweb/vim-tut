                                                     *toggle_unit_tests-usage*
Usage:

Use this plug-in when you are doing Test-Driven Development [TDD] in any
language to quickly switch between unit-test and production code. To make this
really fast bind the Toggle function to a function key in your .vimrc:

    "   [F3]    toggles between (header, ) source and test files.
    nnoremap    <F3> :<C-U>TUT<CR>

This plug-in assumes source and unit test files are in the same directory, as
I believe this to be best practice.

                                                  *toggle_unit_tests-mappings*
Mappings:

<Leader>tut   or   <Plug>ToggleUnitTestsToggle
    Toggles betwixt source and unit test file

                                                  *toggle_unit_tests-commands*

Commands:

:TUT
	Toggles betwixt source and unit test file

                                                  *toggle_unit_tests-settings*
Settings:

By default, unit_test filenames are deemed to begin with 't_'. 

Tell toggle_unit_tests.vim your own prefix by setting the following global
variable, perhaps in your .vimrc:

    let g:unit_test_prefix='test_'
